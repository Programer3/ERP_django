This is present in Django Admin -> Attendance (<http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/info/attendanceclass/>).

**Secret key and Debug value should ke kept secret in a file named ".env" file which is ignored by .gitignore and can be read using "environ" package coded in**  

**In the same directory of settings.py create a file named ".env" and then put your secret key, Debug value and all the other sensitive passwords which an attacker might misuse such as creating own hashes for website, like :  

>SECRET_KEY=xyz  
>DEBUG=FALSE

**Also DEBUG should be kept false during production**  

(remember not to use any space across equals-to("==") sign and also write everything without quotes)

To stop git from tracking your virtualenviroment cfg file once its already being tracked use:

```bash
git rm --cached virtualenvname/pyvenv.cfg
```

```bash
git commit -m "Stop tracking virtualenvname/pyvenv.cfg"
```
