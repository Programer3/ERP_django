How to Select the Virtual Environment
If you miss the popup or choose not to set it at that moment, you can manually select the virtual environment using the following steps:

    Open Command Palette: Press Ctrl + Shift + P (or Cmd + Shift + P on macOS) to open the Command Palette.
    Select Interpreter: Type Python: Select Interpreter and hit Enter. This will display a list of available Python interpreters, including any virtual environments detected by VS Code.
    Choose Your Environment: Look for your newly created virtual environment in the list (it typically appears with its path). Select it to set it as the interpreter for your workspace.
